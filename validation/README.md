# Validation folder

This folder contains scripts and outputs for solution verification (SV):

- trivy_runs/: repeated Trivy scenario experiments (ignored by git)
- ml_cv/: ML cross-validation outputs (ignored by git)
- hybrid_runs/: Decision Gate scenario outputs (ignored by git)
- summary/: final CSV/JSON summary tables used in the thesis (tracked)

Commit only the scripts + summary results to keep the repo lightweight.
